            <p>
            "Our mission is to raise awareness
about the harmful effects of paper cups
on the environment and human health.
These cups contain plastic linings that
make them difficult to recycle, leading to waste.

When not disposed of properly, they end up in landfills,
contributing to soil and water pollution. The production of
paper cups also requires significant resources,
from trees to water, exacerbating deforestation.
Moreover, chemicals in the cups can leach into beverages,
posing potential risks to human health."

This continuation emphasizes the ongoing environmental and health issues related to paper cup usage.
